#React Boilerplate
##Made by Jake W

##What is it?
A boilerplate is a simple config which allows you to start up a project with the same basic development environment.
To get this boilerplate working, after cloning it do the following:
```
npm init
```
This initialises the project, allowing you to give it a name among other things
```
npm install
```
This installs all the modules
```
npm start
```
This starts the server, navigate to localhost:8080 and it should work
